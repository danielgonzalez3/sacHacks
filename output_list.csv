Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks."
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. "
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[4][5] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics."
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. 
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com," For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. "
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers."
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system:"
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[8][9] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification"
Daniel,Gonzalez,rPgl_IrqSKGOc7Sl2cYNkQ,gonzalez.daniel841@gmail.com,"As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis."
